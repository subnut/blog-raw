Ever heard about the `D` process state in Linux? People say that the _D_ stands
for _Disk sleep_, but I personally believe it means _dreaded_. You can't even
`kill -9` it!

Don't forget to mention the fact that you can check the kernel call that the
process is hanging on using the `wchan` field of `ps`
```
ps axopid,comm,wchan
```
